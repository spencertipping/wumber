# TODO
## High-level
1. [Self-contained modeling DSL](design/model-dsl.md)
2. Provide an interactive shell on the terminal, linked to the view


## CSG
+ Tool path profile functions
+ Turning/milling operations with drive code?
+ Chamfers and fillets?


## Sketch
+ Angled go-until things (e.g. "30Â° slope, dx = 5")
+ Compound `j` instructions
+ No more `replicateM_`; we want things like mirror, screw, extrude, etc (push
  inductive state management into the replicator)
+ Use less state; we want relative forks to be easy to write
  + e.g. chains like `jz (-2); rz 90; nema_17`
+ Waypoints/markers we can refer back to?


## Library
+ Machine bolt profiles, threading macros
+ NEMA stepper models
+ Arduino models
+ PCB elements
+ Prototyping breadboards
+ Common ball bearings
+ TGP shafts
+ Dimensional lumber
+ Material properties
  + Wood
  + A36 steel
  + Hardened steel
  + Aluminum


## FEA
+ Mesh to quads
+ Nonuniform/anisotropic material definitions (e.g. wood with knots)
+ Re-mesh to accommodate sharp force-distribution gradients
+ FEM for electronics
+ FEM for magnetics


## Rendering for development
+ Focus on specific elements
+ Focal plane
+ Snap view to align with specific things
+ CLI search
+ Face shading?
+ Rulers/guides for display
  + Rulers should exist both for manually-specified and solved constraints
  + Relative importance and screen-space tradeoffs: show what matters
  + Do 3D projection up front, then layout the OSD like a 2D system


## Export for manufacturing
+ Export to STL or similar
+ Export to Gerber for EDA
+ Export to cross-section PDFs or images
  + BigPrint-style image tiling?


## CNC
+ Generate toolpaths and tool geometry constraints
  + e.g. 1/2"x2" endmill, 4"x10" work envelope
  + Tolerances?


## Notes
### Shell
[Full design here.](design/shell.md)


### JIT
JIT may or may not be worth it. It has two performance advantages: (1) we can
get rid of Haskell's polymorphic dispatch (50% faster, maybe); and (2) we can
use AVX for certain parts of the code -- but (2) isn't straightforward; we still
have a lot of scalar logic.

I don't think JIT makes sense out of the gate.

At some point down the line I'd like to try making an auto-vectorizer that finds
parallel expressions and builds an AVX pipeline to evaluate them. Processors
only barely make this type of thing worthwhile, though -- and many don't support
AVX.

# TODO
## Construction DSL
+ Compound `j` instructions
+ Polygons with holes?
+ Maybe watch SolidWorks videos to see how this stuff is normally done
+ Alias for `replicateM_`
+ Get rid of `mm` and `cm`
+ Use less state; we want relative forks to be easy to write
  + e.g. chains like `jz (-2); rz 90; nema_17`
+ Angled go-until things (e.g. "30Â° slope, dx = 5")
+ Local markers and refs? Haskell vars are indirect, and get erased.
+ Rulers/guides for display


## Rendering
+ Focus on specific elements
+ Focal plane
+ Snap view to align with specific things
+ CLI search
+ Face shading?

# 2D modeling
I want to be able to use wumber's constraint system (and possibly iso stuff) to
produce diagrams and other abstract structures. I think this will end up being
related to EDA use cases, but it's fine if it's its own thing.

Basically the premise is, "here's a graph structure; lay it out for me using
these rules". It's more than something like graphviz because we may have
alignment/space constraints. For the EDA use case we'll have things like maximum
trace length.

I think all of this generalizes into some sort of 2D modeling setup where we can
both sketch and construct. We may or may not care about CSG, so I don't think we
need to reduce every object to an iso representation. Naive boundaries should be
fine.


## Getting there
I need to make a few changes:

1. Shapes as objects with boundary hints
2. Simplify trivial equivalences and linear subsystems in constraints
3. Add sketch objects: no volume/area, just indicators
4. Add labels

It would also be interesting to have constraint solutions be objects of their
own. For example, I should be able to linearly interpolate between two
solutions. Does this mean constraint solutions are themselves simplified
constraint sets? (Perhaps: I think we can trivially interpolate between
constraint sets.)
